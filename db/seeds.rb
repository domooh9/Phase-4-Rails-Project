    story: "Smartness is not limited to intellect. Contrary to popular opinion, smartness is not about brains and IQ. It‚Äôs also not about good looks or confidence. There‚Äôs more to a smart person than meets the eye. It‚Äôs an irony that many smart people are oblivious of their smartness. They second guess themselves at the drop of a hat. On the other hand, you also come across not-so-smart people who can‚Äôt stop bragging about themselves. Charles Bukowski echoed a similar thought when he said, ‚ÄúThe problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are full of confidence.‚Äù",

We all have.Literally, you have designed every detail of your life to protect yourself from the fears and internal conflicts you aren‚Äôt willing to face.In his book, The Untethered Soul, Michael Singer gives the analogy of a person with a thorn in their arm. This thorn happens to be pierced right on a nerve. Consequently, with the slightest brush of the thorn, an electrifying pain shoots throughout his entire body.In order for this person to live without pain, he has to make sure nothing touches the thorn in his arm. He can‚Äôt sleep on his bed ‚Äî if he rolls over he‚Äôll touch the thorn. So he creates a device to sleep in to protect the thorn. Problem solved.",
